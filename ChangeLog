	* www/index.py: Use pysqlite2, as below. Also it seems that we
	need to use a unicode-capable quoter now -- steal one from django.
	Redo the tag cloud algorithm to cope with larger tag numbers.

	* sync/original-sync-from-f-spot: Use pysqlite2, which wraps
	sqlite3, as f-spot has upgraded now. This means that all sql
	statements need to be changed.
	(init): Add a --force-db-copy argument.
	(main): Respect --force-db-copy.
